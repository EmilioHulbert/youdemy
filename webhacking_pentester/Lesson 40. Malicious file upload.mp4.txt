THIS SECTION IS ABOUT SERVER SIDE INJECTIONS
ATTACKING SERVER ITSELF AND GETTING A SHELL
FILE UPLOAD IS PROMISING
The upload of php file just tells the server that its running

{"wp-auth-check":true,"server_time":1735675201}
circumvent dont use browser use another way set burp to intercept and rename to test.php all names and change content also
browser thought we were uploading a text file then we changed file contents in burp
if server has php then we have code execution on the server
webshell =small web app that allows shell access to the target
nice simple shell
