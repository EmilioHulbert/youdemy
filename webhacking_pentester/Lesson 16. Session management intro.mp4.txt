SESSION MANAGEMENT
HTTP IS A STATELESS PROTOCOL
IF YOU SEND 2 REQUEST TO THE SAME SERVER,IT HAS NO IDEA IT CAME FROM THE SAME PERSON
web app gens an id and put it in memory for a user session
in browser its a cookie
COOKIE CAN HAVE:
DOMAIN: FACEBOOK.COM: HERE WILL FIT ALL SUBDOMAINS 
PATH: / OR somedir
TIME: XXX HOW LONG COOKIE IF VALID
THIS WAY SERVER KNOWS IT'S YOU
RT REQ HAS NO COOKIE BUT RESPONSE HAS SET-COOKIE HEADER
THEN FROM THERE THE REST REQUESTS HAVE COOKIE SET
IShTTPoNLY FALSE cookie can't be accessed by js and get it with cross site scripting..
secure flag cookie can be sent via unencrypted channel or only encrypted channel
cookie can be session cookie or permanenet cookie
arstechnica.com
Remove cookie and get auth error then that is the sesion cookie
tomcat jsessionid
at times its not obvious
server wont know who you are anymore
