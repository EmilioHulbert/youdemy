load url
http://10.10.10.6/ii/wp-admin
it takes you to
http://10.10.10.6/ii/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.10.6%2Fii%2Fwp-admin%2F&reauth=1
just a way for the browser to remember where i wanted to go
send to repeater alter 
to

log=vader&pwd=ForceGripForTheWin&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F&testcookie=1
##I DID NOT HAVE INTERNET AT THIS POINT
problem is the application allows external redirects
prob can be solved by only limiting redirects to local domain
